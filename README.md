# Optimal Binary Search Tree (OBST) Implementation

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12%2B-blue)

A Python implementation of three approaches to construct Optimal Binary Search Trees (OBST) with probability-based node placement.

##  Overview
This project implements:
1. **Recursive algorithm** (brute-force)
2. **Divide & Conquer with Memoization** (dynamic programming)
3. **Greedy algorithm** (heuristic)

OBST minimizes expected search cost by placing frequently accessed nodes closer to the root.

## Features
- Three distinct algorithms for comparison
- Time complexity analysis
- Visual tree printing
- Extensive test cases (4 to 250 keys)
- Runtime benchmarking
